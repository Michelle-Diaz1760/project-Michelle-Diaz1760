## Program Description
The program that I've created this semester is a personalized budget planner that will allow users to either make a monthly budget plan to follow in accordance with their income and expenses, or to test out whether they passed or failed their current budget plan(e.i. they went over the limit for non-essentials or didn't save enough). If the user would want to make a monthly budget planner, they will be provided a wage calculator that will output the amount of average income they get on a weekly, monthly, and annual basis. Using that calculated income, they will insert a list of their income, including name and amount. After typing "done", the program will output the total monthly income amount for the user. The program will then ask for the list of expenses for both variable and fixed expenses, asking for input of the name and amount. After typing "done", the program will output the total monthly expenses amount for the user. Using the total income amount and the total expenses amount, the program will calculate the net income the user has. By the net income the user will be able to input the percentage of money they want to save on a monthly basis. The pr0gram will calculate how much money they should be saving monthly. By taking away the amount of money that should be saved monthly from the  net income, the program will output the amount of money the user can use for non-essentials(e.i. new game, accessories, etc). Finally, the user will be able to input whether they want to see the summary of the budget plan for a weekly, monthly, or annual basis. After “done” is typed, the program will end. Now, if the user wants to see if they are on track on their current budget plan, the user will be able to insert a list of their income, including name and amount. After typing "done", the program will output the total monthly income amount for the user. The program will then ask for the list of expenses for both variable and fixed expenses, asking for input of the name and amount. After typing "done", the program will output the total monthly expenses amount for the user. The program will ask how much money they saved for that month. Then, the program will then ask for the list of non-essential expenses, asking for input of the name and amount. After typing "done", the program will output the total monthly non-essential expenses amount for the user. Using the monthly total income, expenses, savings, and non-essential expenses, the user will be able to choose whether they want to use their own budget plan(e.i. 65-20-15) or use a default budget plan(e.i. 50-30-20) to see if they are on track on their budget. The program will test the individual component, if the user’s amount passes the budget, then it will output “passed!” but if it doesn’t, it will indicate they failed and add a suggestion on what they have to do.

## Software Engineering
For this project, I’ve implemented the Waterfall Life Cycle Model. Since I had a timeline of six weeks for this project, each week of the project will be dedicated to one stage of the project. The six stages consist of requirements analysis, design, implementation, validation, installation, and maintenance. For the first week, I worked on requirements analysis, researching budget plans and their individual components, as well as review functions that I will most likely have to implement in the program like a dictionary and while loops. By the second week, I worked on design, in which I separated my program by the components of the budget planner, like income, expenses, savings, and non-essential and created a basic flowchart to follow since all the components followed a similar framework. By the third week, I started on a rough draft of my code without doing much debugging yet. I coded my program on Visual Studio Code, using the flowchart to guide how I’ll implement the loops for my program since while and for loops can be confusing. For the fourth week, I got feedback from various different sources and fixed any bugs that the program had and implemented exceptions for input that wasn't the type the input wants(e.i. Input of a string when it needs an integer). For the fifth week, I still worked on debugging the program and adding any additional features that could enhance the user’s experience interacting with the program. I was manually testing my program. By the sixth and final week, I worked on installation and maintenance of the program to see and double check that everything worked out smoothly and responded properly to the input given. 

## Testing Script
1. For every input that the program has I entered a string, integer, and float
2. If the input specifically asks for a string, I entered alpha-numercial characters 
3. If the input specifically asks for a float, I enter alpha-numercial characters and if there was a float, it would continue with the code, but if it wasn’t a float,    then it would raise an exception and print that it was incorrect. 
4. If the input specifically asks for an integer, I enter alpha-numercial characters and if there was a float or integer, it would continue with the code, but if it      wasn’t an integer, then it would raise an exception and print that it was incorrect. 
5. For variables that asked for specific strings, like yes, no, and done, I enter the different words, as well as the specific words in different capitalization. If      they were entered in different capitalization, then the program would lower it and continue with the function. If it wasn’t the string asked for, then it would keep    asking the user the same question until they got it right. 
6. I entered a negative number for all input to see if it would display the absolute value of the number since my program should not accept negative input.
7. I entered more money for expenses compared to income so that it would return a negative number, and therefore make sure that the saving amount and non-essential        were zero to indicate that the user is in debt. 
8. For my PERpassORfail functions, I entered a variety of numbers that didn’t add up to hundred, that went over hundred, and did add up to hundred. If they didn’t add    up to hundred or went over, the program would ask them again until it’s the correct number.
