## Program Description

The program that I am planning to create this semester is a personalized budget planner that allows for the user to personalize a budget planner without the need for them to calculate their income, bills, savings, and personalized expenses. The program will accept personalized budget percentage plans (e.i. 50-25-25) but its default will be set to the common 50-30-20 rule that most budgets follow. The program will also have a to-do list/calendar section in which the user can write when bills need to be paid, the amount needed, and if they paid it already for that specific month. My goals of my program consist of being able to get the total income of the user’s input, get the total amount of bills needed to pay by the user, subtracting those amounts, and calculate the savings and personal expenses  based on the amount that is left. The planner will be a monthly planner, but it will also have the ability to give the user their data for a yearly budget, as well as weekly, just not in much depth. 

## Software Engineering

For this project, I will be implementing the Waterfall Life Cycle Model. Since I have a timeline of six weeks for this project, each week of the project will be dedicated to one stage of the project. The six stages consist of requirements analysis, design, implementation, validation, installation, and maintenance. I'll start out by creating my flowcharts and pseudocode so that I can organize my data in a way that can be easily changed or moved around. Then I will start my code based on my flowchart, using python language as well as HTML. I will test my project manually to see if the calculations are done correctly, but for further security, I will implement a unit test to test out the modules. The following weeks will be dedicated to debugging and more HTML and CSS so that the project looks nice. 
## Testing Script

Describe the testing process using paragraphs and numbered bullet lists how to manually test the software here. 

Since my program consists of simple arithmetic, I can check for any errors by individually entering each calculation in the computer and see if the calculations match up with those of the program. The process will take a long time but it is one way to approach it. However, a program consists of more than just testing out the arithmetic of the program, so in order to test if the module is functioning correctly, I would have to implement a unit test. I am not sure how to create a unit test but with time and research, I’ll make sure to have it done before my project comes to an end.
